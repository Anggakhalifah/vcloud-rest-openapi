# vCloud Rest OpenAPI definitions

This is a work in progress.

This will be a repository of OpenAPI definitions for vCloud's Rest API.

vCloud Director has an official OpenAPI, but it contains little of the
functionality of the Rest API.

## Work in Progress Milestones

1. Create minimal OpenAPI definitions ✓
2. Add routes ❌
3. Add types ⚠ - Types should work for the most part, but there are corner
   cases.
